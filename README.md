*A more secure way to run scripts from the web*

Because `curl | sh` or `wget | sh` is a little to cowboy for the world we live in.
Use cryptographic hashes to check what is downloaded is what you expect _before_ you run the script.

## Notes
Just because a script from the internet has a checksum, does make it safe or good. It only ensures that all people will get the same version. I would suggest reading and understanding any script from a third party you do not fully trust *before* running it on your machine.

The SHA-1 and MD5 hashes are included so as to work with all widely used hashes. However, these particular hashes have practical demonstrable attacks and should be avoided if at all possible.


## Examples
`$ pincers --sha3 962309203a6dd66167d09558326176175894cdd0809edb950442c910cee868a2 https://sh.rustup.rs`

`$ pincers --sha2 bb7e8f51023ab8b054c6578591fa0dc361ceeb08744e5cd1f0e551235c4912b2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh`
